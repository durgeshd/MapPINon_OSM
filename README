== Overview ==
MapPIN'on OSM is mapping photos introducing Network (service) on OpenStreetMap.
Ususal photo blogs generate RSSes. This system read those RSS and try to get
geometrical location of photo files with JPEG EXIF GPS tags or georss tags.

This system needs 2 our servers and other photo blog sites to provide us RSSes.
One of the server is HTTP sercer which must be show in public internet. We call
it as the HTTP server. Another sever don't needed to be shown in public but should
be able to access internet in order to get RSSes and photo JPEG files. We call
it as the background server.

== Install ==
=== the HTTP server ===
Copy the all directory under htdocs to it.

=== the background server ===
The background server depends on 
* Sun Java 1.5
* Metadata Extractor 2.3.1 (http://www.drewnoakes.com/code/exif/)
** place Metadata Extractor on lib/metadata-extractor-2.3.1.jar

It can run just type
java -jar MapPIN.jar [command] [args]

* add: adding RSSes.
* read: read RSSes and photo files listed on the RSSes from internet and update local databases
* tile: make photo markers tiles from local databases
