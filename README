== Overview ==
MapPIN'on OSM is mapping photos introducing Network (service) on OpenStreetMap.
Ususal photo blogs generate RSSes. This system read those RSS and try to get
geometrical location of photo files with JPEG EXIF GPS tags or georss tags.

This system needs 2 our servers.
One of the server is the HTTP server which must be show in public internet. We call
it as the foreground server. Another sever don't needed to be shown in public but should
be able to access internet in order to get RSSes and photo JPEG files. We call
it as the background server.

== Dependence ==
The background server depends on
* Sun Java Development Kit 1.5 or later.
* Metadata Extractor 2.3.1 ( http://www.drewnoakes.com/code/exif/ )
** put metadata-extractor-2.3.1.jar into lib/
* Flickrj ( http://flickrj.sourceforge.net/ )
** put flickrapi-1.2.jar into lib/

The foreground server depends on nothing special. If you are not publishing
data, you don't need http server. You can run the index.html.* file on your
browser directory.

== Build ==
If your system have ant version 1.7.1 or later, just type

$ ant

This is automatically download dependance files and builds up both servers:
* the backgorund server (dist/MapPINon.jar)
* the HTTP server (htdocs/index.html.*)

== Install ==
Move
* dist/MapPINon.jar to ./
* config.txt.sample to config.txt
and edit config.txt to configure the foreground server behavior.

== Run ==
Then, it can be run just type:

java -jar MapPINon.jar [command] [args]

commands are
* add: adding RSSes.
* get: getting RSS registration file form forground server.
* read: read RSSes and photo files listed on the RSSes from internet and update local databases
* tile: make photo markers tiles from local databases
* loop: just do "read" and "tile".

=== Registing RSSes ===
For first of all, collecting URLs of RSSes for geotagged photos. Then, input
a command like this:

java -jar MapPINon.jar add 'http://www.flickr.com/sercice/feed?....'\
 'http://picasaweb.google.com/feed?...' 'http://...'

or write this kind of text file somewhere:

http://www.flickr.com/sercice/feed?....
http://picasaweb.google.com/feed?...
http://...

and specify the URL on config.txt, then
java -jar MapPINon.jar get

The RSS list are recoded in a file. The file name is 'rss.json.gz' as default.
You can change the name in config.txt.

=== Reading photo data ===
Type
java -jar MapPINon.jar read
to get all photo data listed on RSSes.

The photo list are recoded in a file. The file name is 'photo.json.gz' as
default. You can change the name in config.txt.

=== Making tile ===
Type
java -jar MapPINon.jar tile
to create photo markers tiles of getton photo data.

The photo markers tile are created under a directory. The directory is
'htdocs/data/' as default. You can change the name in config.txt.

=== Browsing ===
Open your web browser and specify the address
file://(the base directory of the MapPIN'on OSM forground server)/htdocs/index.html.(your language)

=== Publishing ===
Copy the all directory under htdocs/ to your HTTP server.
